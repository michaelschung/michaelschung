## Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Stanford University in 2018 with my B.S. in Computer Science, and spent the next six years teaching high school Math and CS (picking up an M.S.Ed. from UPenn along the way). I'm currently mid-batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), working to pivot back into software roles.

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: NodeJS, Postgres, and generally how to deploy a product
- ðŸ”§ Currently working on: small web apps that explore interesting STEM topics!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: the Recurse Center, hiking, or the vast potential of AI within education
