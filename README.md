## Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Stanford University in 2018 with my B.S. in Computer Science, and spent the next six years teaching high school Math and CS (picking up an M.S.Ed. from UPenn along the way). I'm currently working to pivot back into product/software roles, and just finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: React, TypeScript, and TDD through [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: my recent Moon project, hiking, or the vast potential of AI within education
